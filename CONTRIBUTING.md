# How to contribute

This repo is a reference and learning resource and everyone is invited to contribute, however not all PRs will be accepted into the main branch !

## Coding Standards

There are no explicit coding standards so pay attention to the general coding style, that's (mostly) used everywhere.

### General Steps

1. Issues are managed as usual with the regular issues list, just like any other repo.

2. Once an issue is marked as a bug, enhancement, new feature or whatever needs development work, it will be labeled as a **backlog-item** and included as the last item in the Backlog project column.
